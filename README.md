Answers to problems of Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net/) in Common Lisp. 

What is Project Euler?
----------------------
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

Why in CLisp?
----------------------
Well, why not? Lisp is both a powerful and beautiful programming language. 
Functional programming goes very well with these kind of mathematical problems as you can express the algorithms in a clear and concise manner.
Further I really wanted to practise my Lisp, which over the years has become rusty.

How to use these programs?
--------------------------
New problems are constantly being added to Project Euler. Each file in this project represents a single problem, hence named problemN.lisp.
The Linux GNU CLISP implementation has been used to run these problems, but should work on any ANSI compliant Lisp implementation.
To execute a single file, say problem 1, just run:

  $> clisp problem1.lisp
